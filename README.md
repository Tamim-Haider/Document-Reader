# Document-Reader
This project is a Python-based document reader software designed to read and convert written documents into spoken audio. The application supports multiple document formats, including TXT, PDF, and Microsoft Word (DOC/DOCX), allowing users to listen to their documents instead of reading them manually.
The Python Document Reader Software is an intelligent application that converts text from various document formats into audible speech. It supports common file types such as TXT, PDF, and Word documents, making it a versatile tool for reading different kinds of digital content.

The software works by first identifying the document type selected by the user. It then uses appropriate Python libraries to extract text from the file. Once the text is extracted, it is passed to a text-to-speech engine, which reads the content aloud in real time. The system ensures smooth and continuous reading for large documents as well.

This application is particularly beneficial for:

Visually impaired users

Students who prefer audio learning

Professionals who want to listen to documents while working

Anyone seeking hands-free document access
